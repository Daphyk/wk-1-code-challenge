# Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator.
Based on the marks entered, this program creates and shows student grades. It prompts the user to enter the student's marks between 0 and 100, and then provides the matching letter grade based on these criteria: 

* A: more than 79
* B: 60 to 70
* C: 59 to 49
* D: 40 to 49
* E: fewer than 40

# Getting started
* Run the program: use javascript environment, such as the terminal, run node grade.js.
* Input: When the software is run, it will request the user to enter a student's grade between 0 and 100.
* Output: The program will generate the corresponding grade based on the provided marks and display it in an alert box.
* Validation: The program includes input validation to guarantee that the marks entered are within the defined range. If the input is invalid, the user will be prompted to submit valid marks. The program will keep prompting the user until proper marks are entered. Once legitimate marks have been input and the grade has been shown, the program will terminate.
